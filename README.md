# Value-Quality-Momentum-Strategy
Developed and backtested over 10 years a factor-based equity strategy (Value, Quality, Momentum) on S&P 500 stocks, achieving 12.96% annualized return vs. 11.28% benchmark S&P500 with lower Max Drawdown (-29,34% vs. -33,92%).
Built a composite alpha signal using valuation (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/B), profitability (ROE), leverage, and momentum filters, implemented semi-annual rebalancing and risk controls (VaR, CVaR, Max Drawdown, Stop-loss).
Projet implemented with Python using data from yfinance.
